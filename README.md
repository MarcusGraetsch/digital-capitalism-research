# Digitalpolitik & Modern Capitalism Research Project

A systematic investigation of digital capitalism through the lens of Marxist political economy.

## Project Goal
Develop a comprehensive analysis of the contemporary capitalist system in its "ideal average" — analogous to Marx's analysis of industrial capitalism in *Capital* and the *Grundrisse*.

## Research Phases

1. **Literature Mapping** (Current) — Comprehensive survey and evaluation
2. **Deep Reading** — Systematic engagement with primary sources
3. **Conceptual Synthesis** — Developing theoretical framework
4. **Manuscript Drafting** — Writing the analysis

## Key Questions

- What constitutes the "digital" in digital capitalism? Is it infrastructure, logic, or epoch?
- How does data extraction relate to classical value theory?
- What are the genuinely new antagonisms vs. intensified old contradictions?
- Where is the locus of class struggle in platform economies?
