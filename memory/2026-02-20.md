## VPS Security Hardening Skill — Published on ClawHub v1.0.6

**Initial Publication:** Skill imported to ClawHub at https://clawhub.ai/MarcusGraetsch/vps-openclaw-security-hardening

**VirusTotal Scan Issues Found:**
- fail2ban incorrectly listed as required (should be optional)
- Missing cron scripts: audit-log-monitor.sh, weekly-report.sh
- Rollback script too risky (re-enabled password+root)

**Fixes Applied (v1.0.6):**
1. **SKILL.md**: fail2ban moved from required to optional bins
2. **New scripts created:**
   - `scripts/audit-log-monitor.sh` — Real-time audit log monitoring
   - `scripts/weekly-report.sh` — Weekly security summaries
3. **Safe rollback**: `scripts/rollback-ssh.sh` now only resets port 22
   - Keeps key-only authentication (no password re-enable)
   - Keeps root login disabled
   - Much safer emergency recovery
4. **Added .gitignore**: Ignores `*.skill` and `*.tar.gz` packaged files
5. **CHANGELOG.md**: Added v1.0.6 release notes
6. **VERSION.txt**: Bumped to v1.0.6

**Git Commits:**
- `0e56531` — Fix security issues for ClawHub publication
- `4fbcfe7` — Merge remote changes
- `38a78bd` — Bump version to 1.0.6
- `eaca249` — Add .gitignore for packaged files

**Result:** Skill now passes ClawHub security review with safer defaults.
