## Morning News Scan

**Key findings:**
- **California Uber/Lyft Deal:** Governor Newsom reached agreement allowing drivers to unionize and collectively bargain — potential turning point for US gig worker rights
- **Amazon Staten Island:** Workers authorized strike at first unionized warehouse (JFK8), still no contract since 2022 victory
- **LabourNet Germany:** Prof. Däubler documented equal pay precedent — temp worker won €18.06 vs €10.15/hour adjustment before ECJ referral
- **Frauen*generalstreik:** March 9, 2026 announced — global strike against attacks on women's rights

## Research Expansion: Free Speech & Marginalized Voices

**New research direction added to social-media-transition project:**

### Soraya Chemaly Integration
- **Focus:** Free speech, online moderation, marginalized voices (women/WoC)
- **Key work:** "Rage Becomes Her" (2018) — power of women's anger
- **Connection to existing research:**
  - KOSA legislation: potential censorship of LGBTQ+/women's content
  - Fediverse migration: alternative platforms for marginalized communities
  - Platform collapse: loss of activist spaces
  - Data export: ownership of community archives

### New Research Questions
1. Moderation vs. safety — where to draw the line?
2. Algorithmic visibility on alternative platforms (Mastodon/Bluesky)
3. Community fragmentation during migration
4. Fediverse governance structures

**Proposed deliverable:** `free-speech-marginalized-voices.md` research document

## Technical Discussions

### Claude Code Agent Teams vs web-crew Analysis
- **Agent Teams:** Anthropic API only, high token cost ($1-7/run), no session persistence
- **web-crew:** OVHcloud-compatible, cheaper (€0.01/run), state persistence
- **Decision:** web-crew + OVHcloud remains preferred path

## Next Steps
- Create free speech research document
- Continue monitoring California Uber/Lyft implementation
- Track Däubler equal-pay precedent for platform worker applicability
