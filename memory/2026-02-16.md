Researched and documented four critical theorists from the "Critique of AI" roundtable at Critical Theory in Berlin:

### Authors Added:
1. **Matteo Pasquinelli** — *The Eye of the Master* (Verso, 2023), Deutscher Memorial Prize 2024. Thesis: Labor is the root of AI's historical development.

2. **Anna-Verena Nosthoff** — *Kybernetik und Kritik* (Suhrkamp, Feb 2026). Thesis: Cybernetization has captured society and critique itself; digital governance through feedback loops.

3. **Roland Meyer** — DIZH Professor Zurich. Research: Networked image cultures, platform aesthetics, standardization of visual imagination.

4. **Rainer Mülhoff** — Professor AI Ethics Osnabrück. Research: AI ethics as power critique, affective manipulation, algorithmic governance.

- Degradation of critical capacities (literacy, reasoning, creativity)
- Platform connection: AI intensifies platform power through "intelligence" illusion
