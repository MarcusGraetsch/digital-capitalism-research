## News Digest Scan Issues — DuckDuckGo CAPTCHA Blocking

**Problem:** DuckDuckGo search blocking 5/7 queries consistently with CAPTCHA challenges. Brave Search also hitting rate limits.

**Current Status:**
- 42 RSS feeds configured in `/root/news-digest/config.json`
- Feeds organized by category but NOT by research relevance
- Daily scans producing limited results due to search blocking

**Analysis of Existing RSS Feeds:**
- 42 feeds across categories: tech-policy (3), tech-mainstream (3), left-analysis (2), labor-de (2), critical-theory (2), uk-left (2), and many single-category feeds
- **Gap identified:** Feeds categorized by source type, not by research dimensions (Geography, Topic, Actors, Language)

**Missing for Comprehensive Coverage:**
1. **Geography:** France (no dedicated feed), UK Labor (Unite), Nordic sources
2. **Topic:** Gig economy specific (only 1 feed), continuous DSA/DMA monitoring
3. **Actors:** Industry associations (Bitkom, eco), church/NGO voices, research funders
4. **Language:** Spanish, Arabic, French feeds for Global South coverage

**Next Step:** User wants systematic approach — "lass uns erst mehr nachdenken welche rss feeds wir brauchen" — too selective currently.

## Methodenhandbuch für KI-gestützte Forschung

**Status:** User developing comprehensive methods handbook with Gemini and Claude (cloud)
- File received: `methodenhandbuch.md` (full draft, ~500 lines)
- Core approach: Historical-materialist research methodology + AI workflows
- Key innovation: "Methodischer Dreiklang" (Synchron/Diachron/Synthese)

**Key Chapters:**
1. Theoretisches Fundament (Marx' General Intellect)
2. Methodischer Dreiklang (Synchron-Prüfung, Diachron-Prüfung, Synthese-Prüfung)
3. KI-Prüf-Workflows (Ideologie-Audit, Proxy-Seed, Kontrafaktisches Prompting)
4. Ethisches Manifest (6 Grundsätze)
5. Primärquellen-Integration mit RAG
6. Bibliografische Vektorenanalyse

**Planned:** GitHub repo creation tomorrow (`methodenhandbuch-ki-forschung`)
- Integration with cyberspace-project research
- Potential website publication at `/methods` or `/research-methods`

## Contabo VM Lifecycle Automation (TODO)

**Idea:** Use Contabo API to start/stop VM automatically (08:00-20:00 CET) to reduce costs
**Options:**
- A) GitHub Actions cron for automatic schedule
- B) Manual on-demand via Telegram buttons
- C) Both combined

**Status:** Added to TODO.md, implementation deferred for later consideration.

## Daily Research Themes (Week of Feb 21-27)

**Consistent findings across scans:**
1. **California Uber/Lyft unionization** — Major precedent, two unions competing
2. **HRW "Gig Trap" report** — 155 pages, central to platform capitalism research
3. **Nordic gig economy (Jacobin)** — Challenges welfare state exceptionalism
4. **EU DMA enforcement** — Apple €500M fine, evaluation due May 2026
5. **LabourNet Germany** — Equal pay campaigns, public sector wage disputes, women's strike March 9

**Research gaps identified:**
- German platform economy news not well covered (DuckDuckGo blocking)
- Need better systematic coverage of EU regulatory developments
- Academic paper tracking (arXiv/SocArXiv working but niche)
