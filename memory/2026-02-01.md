## Work Log

### Local Transcription Setup (In Progress)
Setting up OpenAI Whisper for local voice message transcription to avoid cloud API dependencies.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Installed system dependencies via apt: `python3-pip`, `ffmpeg`, and build tools (210 MB, 225 packages)
- ✅ Initiated pip install of `openai-whisper`

**Installation Details:**
- PyTorch 2.10.0 downloaded (~915 MB)
- NVIDIA CUDA libraries downloaded for GPU acceleration
- Whisper wheel built successfully
- Currently installing collected packages

**Next Steps:**
1. Wait for pip install to complete
2. Verify whisper CLI is available: `which whisper`
3. Download a Whisper model (base or small) for testing
4. Create exec wrapper for integration with OpenClaw

**Notes:**
- Using local transcription instead of cloud APIs (OpenAI Whisper API, Google Speech-to-Text)
- This will enable voice message transcription for Telegram integration
- Installation is large due to PyTorch and CUDA dependencies (~3-4 GB total)
