## Conversation Summary

assistant: ANNOUNCE_SKIP
user: System: [2026-02-04 08:02:22 GMT+1] Cron: News scan complete. Digest sent to main session and TODO.md updated with 6 new actionable items.

**Summary:**
- ✅ **2 successful** DuckDuckGo searches (gig economy + Uber/Lyft labor)
- ✅ **LabourNet.de** checked - found German equal pay victory, welfare reform protests
- ✅ **1 successful** Brave Search (EU DMA) - Apple/Meta first penalties, Google proceedings
- ❌ **5 blocked** by DuckDuckGo CAPTCHA
- ❌ **3 rate-limited** by Brave Search

**Key findings flagged:**
1. **California breakthrough** - Uber/Lyft drivers get collective bargaining rights via SB 371 deal
2. **DMA enforcement** - Apple/Meta first penalized (April 2025), "discreet" EU approach revealed
3. **German precedent** - Leiharbeit equal pay victory via threatened EuGH referral
4. **HRW "Gig Trap"** - 155-page report on algorithmic exploitation archived for reading

**Recommendation:** Consider staggering search timing or using alternative sources (direct RSS feeds from LabourNet, TechPolicy.Press, etc.) to avoid CAPTCHA/rate limits on future scans.
