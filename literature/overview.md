### 2.2 Cognitive Capitalism Debate

| Author | Work (Year) | Core Thesis | Evaluation |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Yann Moulier-Boutang** | *Cognitive Capitalism* (2011) | Knowledge as primary productive force; "General Intellect" stage; bio-political rent | Epistemic: ★★★★☆ Empirical: ★★★☆☆ Political: ★★★★☆ Synthetic: ★★★☆☆ |
| **Carlo Vercellone** | Various (2007-2015) | Formal → real → general intellect; "crisis of the law of value" | Epistemic: ★★★★☆ Empirical: ★★☆☆☆ Political: ★★★☆☆ Synthetic: ★★★☆☆ |
| **Andrea Fumagalli** | *Bioeconomia e capitalismo cognitivo* (2007) | Bio-political valorization; precarity as structural feature | Epistemic: ★★★☆☆ Empirical: ★★★☆☆ Political: ★★★★☆ Synthetic: ★★★☆☆ |
| **Heesang Jeon** | "Cognitive Capitalism or Cognition in Capitalism?" (2010) | Critique of cognitive capitalism's abandonment of value theory | Epistemic: ★★★★★ Empirical: ★★☆☆☆ Political: ★★★☆☆ Synthetic: ★★★★☆ |
| **George Caffentzis** | "Immeasurable Value?" (2005), "The Work/Energy Crisis" (1974) | Cognitive capitalism as "science fiction" — value law persists | Epistemic: ★★★★★ Empirical: ★★☆☆☆ Political: ★★★★☆ Synthetic: ★★★★☆ |

**Critical Assessment of Cognitive Capitalism:**
The Moulier-Boutang/Vercellone thesis has been critiqued (Jeon 2010, Caffentzis 2005) for conflating:
1. Changes in the labor process (immaterial labor)
2. Changes in value measurement ("immeasurability")
3. A supposed crisis of the law of value itself

The "General Intellect" reading of the *Grundrisse* may overstate Marx's position. The "Fragment on Machines" is a speculative draft, not systematic theory. Value theory critique risks becoming post-work utopianism.

### 2.3 Surveillance Capitalism

| **Shoshana Zuboff** | *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* (2019) | Behavioral surplus extraction; prediction products; behavioral modification | Epistemic: ★★★☆☆ Empirical: ★★★★☆ Political: ★★★★★ Synthetic: ★★☆☆☆ |

### 2.4 Class Analysis: Hacker and Vectoralist Classes

| Author | Work (Year) | Core Thesis | Evaluation |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **McKenzie Wark** | *A Hacker Manifesto* (2004) | "Hacker class" produces new abstractions; "vectoralist class" controls vectors of information; class struggle over intellectual property | Epistemic: ★★★★★ Empirical: ★★☆☆☆ Political: ★★★★☆ Synthetic: ★★★★★ |
| **McKenzie Wark** | *The Beach Beneath the Street* (2011), *The Spectacle of Disintegration* (2013) | Situationist legacy; radical media theory; derive in digital space | Epistemic: ★★★★☆ Empirical: ★★☆☆☆ Political: ★★★★☆ Synthetic: ★★★★☆ |
| **McKenzie Wark** | *Capital Is Dead* (2019) | "Is this really capitalism or something worse?"; vectoral power beyond capitalism | Epistemic: ★★★★☆ Empirical: ★★☆☆☆ Political: ★★★★☆ Synthetic: ★★★★☆ |
| **McKenzie Wark** | *Reverse Cowgirl* (2020), various | Trans/feminist interventions in media theory | Epistemic: ★★★★☆ Empirical: ★★☆☆☆ Political: ★★★★☆ Synthetic: ★★★☆☆ |

**Wark's Contribution:**
Wark introduces a distinctive class analysis for the information age:
- **Hacker class**: Produces new information, abstractions, concepts (not necessarily coding)
- **Vectoralist class**: Controls the "vectors" (channels, platforms, infrastructure) along which information flows
- **Worker class**: Traditional industrial labor
- **Peasant class**: Agricultural and informal labor

This framework offers an alternative to both orthodox Marxist class analysis and post-workerist "multitude" concepts. The "vectoralist" anticipates platform capitalism analysis by over a decade.

### 2.5 Technodiversity and Cosmotechnics

| Author | Work (Year) | Core Thesis | Evaluation |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Yuk Hui** | *The Question Concerning Technology in China* (2016) | "Cosmotechnics" — technology as culture-specific; critiques universalist technology narratives | Epistemic: ★★★★★ Empirical: ★★★☆☆ Political: ★★★☆☆ Synthetic: ★★★★☆ |
| **Yuk Hui** | *Recursivity and Contingency* (2019) | Philosophical foundations of cybernetics; alternative modernities | Epistemic: ★★★★★ Empirical: ★★☆☆☆ Political: ★★★☆☆ Synthetic: ★★★☆☆ |
| **Yuk Hui** | *Art and Cosmotechnics* (2021) | Aesthetics and technology; non-Western epistemes | Epistemic: ★★★★☆ Empirical: ★★☆☆☆ Political: ★★★☆☆ Synthetic: ★★★☆☆ |
| **Yuk Hui** (ed.) | *Technodiversity* (2023) | Diversity of technological civilizations; against platform universalism | Epistemic: ★★★★☆ Empirical: ★★★☆☆ Political: ★★★★☆ Synthetic: ★★★★☆ |

**Hui's Contribution:**
Hui provides a philosophical counterweight to the universalism of platform capitalism narratives. His "cosmotechnics" framework asks:
- Is "digital capitalism" the same everywhere, or does it take different forms in different cosmologies?
- Can Chinese, African, Indigenous technological traditions offer alternatives to Silicon Valley model?
- How does recursivity (feedback loops) function differently across cultural contexts?

This challenges the assumption that digital capitalism is a homogeneous global system, suggesting instead a "technodiverse" landscape where platform logic encounters local resistance and transformation.

**Marxist Critique of Zuboff:**
Stanford Law Review critique (2020) and others note:
- Remains at business model level without value theory
- "Behavioral surplus" is descriptive, not explanatory
- Ignores labor process; users are not just "surveilled" but producing
- Technological determinism in "inevitability" narrative

- Is platform extraction rent (monopoly, extra-economic coercion) or profit (surplus value from labor)?
- Srnicek: Platforms extract rent through control of infrastructure
- Fuchs: Data labor produces surplus value, not rent
- Christophers: Rent is structural to contemporary capitalism, not deviation

## 11. EMERGING / UNDERDEVELOPED AREAS (Research Gaps)

### 11.1 Under-Researched Topics

| Gap | Why It Matters | Potential Sources |
|-----|----------------|-------------------|
| **Digital Rent Theory** | Is data extraction rent or profit? No consensus. | Need original work; partial in Dean, Christophers |
| **AI Value Measurement** | If AI "creates," how is value determined? | Steinhoff, Jeon insufficient |
| **Global Value Chains (Digital)** | Ethnographic work on African, South Asian digital labor thin | Graham, but need more depth |
| **Platform Co-ops / Alternatives** | Do they escape extractive logic? | Scholz, Bauwens underdeveloped |
| **Crypto/Blockchain Political Economy** | Is "Web3" new form or same logic? | Few Marxist analyses; Swartz? |
| **Digital War/Security** | Military-digital complex; surveillance as capital | Graham, others scattered |
| **Climate-Digital Nexus** | Energy, e-waste, mining in value theory | Parikka, Gabrys but not integrated |

### 11.2 Geographic Gaps

| Region | Current Coverage | Needed |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Sub-Saharan Africa** | Graham, Birhane spotty | Systematic studies on mobile money, gig work, extractivism |
| **Latin America** | Almost none | Platform economies, digital dependency theory |
| **Southeast Asia** | Some (Philippines moderation) | Comprehensive studies on e-commerce, fintech |
| **Middle East** | Minimal | Platform governance, state-digital relations |
| **Eastern Europe** | Minimal | Post-socialist digital transition, platform precarity |

### 11.3 Disciplinary Gaps

| Gap | Why It Matters |
|-----|----------------|
| **Anthropology + PE** | Ethnographic thickness often missing in Marxist theory |
| **Economic Sociology** | Networks, embeddedness underexplored |
| **Economic History** | Longue durée of digital transformation |
| **Science & Technology Studies** | Co-production, agency of technology |
| **Legal Political Economy** | Platform governance, antitrust, regulation |

## SYNTHESIS: TOWARD AN "IDEAL AVERAGE" ANALYSIS

### What the Literature Shows

1. **No consensus on periodization**: Is this a new stage (digital capitalism), a tendency within late capitalism (surveillance capitalism), or a technological transformation leaving fundamental relations unchanged?

2. **Value theory crisis**: The "cognitive capitalism" debate exposed unresolved tensions. Is knowledge/ data/ attention value-creating or rent-extracting?

3. **Labor pluralism**: The variety of digital labor (gig, cloud, creative, reproductive, unwaged) resists single-framework analysis.

4. **Material turn**: Growing recognition that "digital" is materially embedded (energy, minerals, labor) rather than immaterial.

5. **Global inequality**: Digital capitalism reinforces and transforms North-South dependencies (data colonialism).

### Strongest Contributors to Synthesis

| Combination | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Fuchs + Huws + Christophers** | Fuchs provides systematic Marxist framework; Huws adds global labor empirics; Christophers adds rent theory |
| **Schiller + Parikka + Crawford** | Material infrastructure + environmental limits |
| **Srnicek + Couldry/Mejias** | Platform logic + colonial extractivism |
| **Hardt/Negri + Federici** | Biopolitical production + social reproduction |

### Weakest Links

- Zuboff: Societally influential but theoretically thin
- Moulier-Boutang: Bold thesis, weak value theory
- Varoufakis: Provocative but empirically thin
