# Concept Development: Value of Data

*Theoretical challenges in analyzing data as commodity, capital, or rent*

## The Core Question

Does data have **value** in the Marxist sense (socially necessary labor time)? Or is it:
- **Use-value only** (raw material for value production)
- **Rent-bearing asset** (generates income without value)
- **Fictitious commodity** (Polanyi) — treated as commodity but not produced as one
- Something else entirely?

---

## Marx's Framework

### Classical Marxist Categories

**Commodity** = Use-value + Exchange-value
- Use-value: Satisfies human need
- Exchange-value: Proportion in which use-values exchange
- **Value substance**: Abstract labor (socially necessary labor time)

**Key questions for data:**
1. What is the use-value of data? (Prediction? Behavioral modification?)
2. What determines its exchange-value? (Scarcity? Utility? Labor?)
3. Is there **abstract data labor** producing it?

### Relevant Marx Texts

- *Capital Vol. 1*, Ch. 1 — Commodity form analysis
- *Grundrisse* — "Fragment on Machines"; general intellect
- *Capital Vol. 3* — Fictitious capital; credit system

## Position A: Data Has Value (Produced by Labor)

### Key Proponents
- **Christian Fuchs** — User labor produces data value
- **Sebastian Sevignani** — Value-form analysis of data
- **Andrea Miconi** — Data commodification

### Arguments
1. **User activity IS labor**
   - Time spent on platforms = work time
   - Data traces = products of labor
   - Platforms appropriate this labor → surplus value

2. **Data processing adds value**
   - Algorithmic refinement = productive labor
   - Engineers, data scientists = productive workers
   - Combined: user labor + platform labor = data commodity

3. **Data circulates as commodity**
   - Sold to advertisers (direct)
   - Used to improve services (indirect)
   - Traded on prediction markets

### Measurement Problems
- How to quantify "socially necessary labor time" of scrolling?
- How to separate consumption from production?
- Individual data worth near-zero; aggregated data valuable

### Key Texts
- Fuchs, Christian. "The Digital Labour Theory of Value" (various)
- Sevignani, Sebastian. *Das Kapital sind wir* (2015)
- Miconi, Andrea. "Data Commodification" (2017)

## Position B: Data Has No Value (Rent/Asset Only)

### Key Proponents
- **Jodi Dean** — Data extraction = rent
- **Nick Srnicek** — Data as raw material for AI; value in processing
- **George Caffentzis** — Critique of "immeasurable value"

### Arguments
1. **Data is not produced by labor**
   - Emerges from behavior, not intentional production
   - No "socially necessary labor time" applicable
   - Use-value ≠ value

2. **Data = Natural resource/raw material**
   - Like land, oil, air
   - Generates rent through scarcity/ownership
   - Value added in processing (algorithms, AI)

3. **Commodity fetishism critique**
   - Treating data as commodity = ideological
   - Real relations: extraction, enclosure, colonialism

### Counter-arguments to A
- If user activity is labor, so is breathing
- Blurs distinction between production and consumption
- "Everything is work" = "Nothing is work"

### Key Texts
- Caffentzis, George. "Immeasurable Value?" (2005)
- Srnicek, Nick. *Platform Capitalism* (2017), Ch. 3
- Dean, Jodi. "The Neofeudalising Tendency" (2024)

## Position C: Data as Fictitious Commodity (Polanyi)

### Key Proponents
- **Andrea Miconi** — Data commodification
- **Jathan Sadowski** — Data capital; datafication
- **Karl Polanyi** — *The Great Transformation* (1944)

### Polanyi's Framework
Fictitious commodities: Labor, Land, Money
- Treated as commodities in markets
- NOT produced for sale
- Fictitious = commodity form applied to non-commodities

**Is data the 4th fictitious commodity?**

### Arguments
1. **Data not produced for sale**
   - Byproduct of activity
   - Enclosed and commodified post-hoc

2. **Market in data destabilizes society**
   - Privacy destruction
   - Prediction/control
   - Democracy erosion

3. **Requires state intervention**
   - Like labor protections, land regulation
   - GDPR as primitive attempt

### Key Texts
- Miconi, Andrea. "Data Commodification" (2017)
- Sadowski, Jathan. *Too Smart* (2020)
- Polanyi, Karl. *The Great Transformation* (1944)

## Position D: Data as Fictitious Capital

### Key Proponents
- **David Harvey** — Financialization analysis
- **Martijn Konings** — Financial temporality
- **Cédric Durand** — Fictitious capital returns

### Arguments
1. **Value is anticipated, not realized**
   - Platform valuations based on future data potential
   - Stock prices ≠ current data value
   - Speculative bubble dynamics

2. **Financial logic dominates**
   - Data gathering = securing future income streams
   - Similar to credit instruments
   - Asset price inflation

3. **Crisis tendencies**
   - Fictitious capital → crashes
   - 2000 dot-com; potential future platform crash?

## Empirical Dimensions

### What IS "data" anyway?

| Type | Example | Source | Potential Value |
|------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Behavioral | Click patterns, dwell time | User activity | Prediction |
| Demographic | Age, location, income | Profile data | Targeting |
| Relational | Social graph, connections | Network data | Influence mapping |
| Content | Posts, photos, videos | User creation | Training AI |
| Transactional | Purchases, payments | Platform use | Credit scoring |
| Sensor | Location, biometrics | Device data | Real-time tracking |

### Different data → different value logics?

- **Content data** — Might fit labor theory (creative production)
- **Behavioral data** — More like rent from observation
- **Sensor data** — Ambiguous; device extends body?
- **Transactional data** — Financial information; credit logic

---

## Critical Questions

### 1. Individual vs. Aggregate
- Is individual data worthless, aggregate valuable?
- Marx's value theory applies to individual commodities
- Network effects = collective valorization?

### 2. Real-time vs. Historical
- Real-time data = higher value?
- Temporal dimension of data value
- Storage, decay, obsolescence

### 3. Context-dependence
- Same data, different values in different contexts
- Medical data vs. shopping data
- Class, race, geography affect data value

### 4. Production vs. appropriation
- Who "produces" data? (User? Platform? Both?)
- Enclosure of commons vs. ex novo production
- Primitive accumulation analogy

## Our Working Hypothesis

*Tentative synthesis:*

Data is **not** a commodity in the classical sense (no SNLT), but it is:

1. **A resource** appropriated through enclosure (like land)
2. **An input** to value production (like raw materials)
3. **A rent-bearing asset** due to monopoly/aggregation
4. **A fictitious commodity** in Polanyi's sense
5. **A form of fictitious capital** in financialized platforms

The **value** of data emerges from:
- **Scarcity control** (who has it)
- **Aggregation effects** (size of dataset)
- **Processing** (algorithms that refine it)
- **Context** (what it's used for)

NOT from:
- Direct labor embodied in data
- Marginal utility (neoclassical)
- Intrinsic properties

This suggests data **mediates** value extraction but is not itself value.

## Empirical Research Needed

1. **Case studies**: How do different platforms value data?
   - Facebook: Ad targeting value
   - Google: Search prediction value
   - Amazon: Purchase prediction value
   - Uber: Supply/demand matching value

2. **Comparative**: Global North vs. Global South
   - Is data from different regions valued differently?
   - Colonial extraction dynamics?

3. **Historical**: How has data valuation changed?
   - 1990s: Data abundant, low value
   - 2010s: Data scarcity (control), high value
   - Future: Data commodification or regulation?
