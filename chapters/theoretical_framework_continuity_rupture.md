# Chapter: Theoretical Framework — Continuity and Rupture in Digital Capitalism

*Draft for research project*

---

## 1. Introduction: The Problem of Periodization

Is digital capitalism a **new stage** of capitalist development, or merely an **intensification** of existing tendencies? This question divides scholars and determines methodological approach.

This chapter establishes the theoretical framework by:
1. **Reviewing classical concepts** and their digital applicability
2. **Mapping debates** on continuity vs. rupture
3. **Proposing a synthetic approach** for empirical investigation

---

## 2. The Continuity Thesis

### 2.1 Core Argument

Proponents (Fuchs, Caffentzis, Jeon, Christophers) argue:

> "The law of value has not been abolished; it operates more intensely than ever."

**Key claims:**
- Platform labor produces surplus value (exploitation continues)
- Rent is internal to capitalism, not beyond it (Durand)
- Digital intensifies real subsumption (algorithmic control)
- Primitive accumulation operates via data enclosure (Couldry/Mejias)

### 2.2 Evidence for Continuity

| Classical Mechanism | Digital Manifestation | Continuity |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Labor exploitation | Gig workers, content moderators, microworkers | Direct |
| Capital accumulation | Platform valuations, surveillance monetization | Modified |
| Class struggle | Worker organizing (Uber, Amazon, Deliveroo) | Direct |
| Crisis tendencies | Platform profit struggles, speculative bubbles | Direct |

### 2.3 Strongest Proponents

**Christian Fuchs** (*Digital Capitalism*, 2022):
- Systematic application of Marxist categories
- Data labor produces surplus value
- Value law not in crisis

**George Caffentzis** (2005, 2013):
- Critique of "cognitive capitalism" abandonment of value theory
- "Immeasurable value?" — measurement problems don't invalidate theory
- General Intellect reading of *Grundrisse* is speculative over-reading

**Cédric Durand** (2020/2024):
- Critique of Varoufakis's "techno-feudalism"
- Rent is fictitious but *internal* to capitalism
- No rupture with capitalist logic

---

## 3. The Rupture Thesis

### 3.1 Core Argument

Proponents (Varoufakis, Srnicek, Moulier-Boutang, Wark) argue:

> "We have left capitalism behind. Platforms constitute a new mode of production."

**Key claims:**
- Platforms extract rent, not profit — "techno-feudalism" (Varoufakis)
- Value law in crisis — knowledge/data cannot be measured by labor time
- Platform as new organizational form (Srnicek)
- "Vectoral class" beyond capitalist class structure (Wark)

### 3.2 Evidence for Rupture

| Classical Category | Digital Transformation | Rupture? |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------|
| Market exchange | Platform as non-market (algorithmic allocation) | Claimed |
| Labor process | "Gosplan algorithm" (central planning in private hands) | Claimed |
| Class structure | "Cloud capitalists" as new ruling class | Claimed |
| Money | Private currencies (stablecoins), platform tokens | Partial |

### 3.3 Strongest Proponents

**Yanis Varoufakis** (*Technofeudalism*, 2023):
- "Cloud capital" creates digital fiefdoms
- 40% cloud rent extraction
- "We have left the terrain of capitalism"

**Nick Srnicek** (*Platform Capitalism*, 2017):
- Platform as new organizational form
- Periodization: surveillance capitalism → platform capitalism
- Data as new raw material

**Yann Moulier-Boutang** (*Cognitive Capitalism*, 2011):
- Knowledge as primary productive force
- "General intellect" stage
- Crisis of the law of value

**McKenzie Wark** (*Capital Is Dead*, 2019):
- "Vectoral class" controls information flows
- Hacker class produces new abstractions
- Class struggle over intellectual property

## 4. The Synthesis: "Intensification with Transformation"

### 4.1 Proposed Framework

Neither pure continuity nor pure rupture captures the complexity.

**Thesis:** Digital capitalism represents **intensification of capitalist tendencies** that **transforms their form** without abolishing their substance.

**Analogy:** Industrial capitalism intensified merchant capital's tendencies (commodification, market expansion) while transforming its form (factory production, wage labor).

Similarly, digital capitalism:
- **Intensifies:** Exploitation, real subsumption, primitive accumulation, fictitious capital
- **Transforms:** Form of labor (gig, data), form of control (algorithmic), form of rent (cloud)

### 4.2 The "Ideal Average" Method

Following Marx's method in *Capital* Vol. 1:

1. **Abstract** from particular platforms to general tendencies
2. **Analyze** how classical mechanisms operate in digital context
3. **Synthesize** modifications needed for empirical validity
4. **Test** against diverse cases (global, sectoral, platform-type)

### 4.3 Testable Propositions

| Proposition | Continuity | Rupture | Empirical Test |
|-------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Platform extraction = profit | Fuchs | Varoufakis | Worker interviews, financial analysis |
| Value law persists | Caffentzis | Moulier-Boutang | Value chain analysis |
| Real subsumption enhanced | Panzieri/Fuchs | Srnicek | Algorithmic management study |
| New class structure | — | Wark | Class composition analysis |
| Data = new commons enclosure | Couldry/Mejias | — | Colonialism comparison |

## 5. Classical Concepts: Validity Matrix

### 5.1 Directly Applicable (Continuity)

| Concept | Digital Application | Evidence |
|---------|--------------------|----------|
| **Labor exploitation** | Gig workers, content moderators | Gray/Suri (*Ghost Work*), Roberts (*Behind the Screen*) |
| **Real subsumption** | Algorithmic management | Wood et al. (2019), Kellogg et al. (2020) |
| **Primitive accumulation** | Data enclosure, platform imperialism | Couldry/Mejias (*Costs of Connection*) |
| **Fictitious capital** | Platform valuations, crypto | Konings (*Capital and Time*) |

### 5.2 Applicable with Modification (Adaptation)

| Concept | Modification | Debate |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Labor theory of value** | Immaterial labor measurement | Fuchs vs. Moulier-Boutang |
| **Rent theory** | Algorithmic rent extraction | Varoufakis vs. Durand |
| **Creative destruction** | Innovation vs. regulatory arbitrage | Schumpeterian critique |
| **Technostructure** | Algorithmic planning | Galbraith updated |

### 5.3 Risk of Over-application (Caution)

| Concept | Risk | Corrective |
|---------|------|------------|
| **General Intellect** | Teleological reading of *Grundrisse* | Caffentzis critique — don't over-read |
| **Post-work utopianism** | Declaring labor obsolete | Federici, Huws — reproduction persists |
| **"New era" declarations** | Premature periodization | Test empirically first |

## 6. Implications for Research Design

### 6.1 Methodological Consequences

**If continuity thesis holds:**
- Use classical Marxist methods (value chain analysis, class composition)
- Focus on empirical specification for digital contexts
- Avoid premature "new era" declarations

**If rupture thesis holds:**
- Develop new conceptual frameworks
- Abandon or radically modify value theory
- Focus on qualitative differences

**Synthesis approach:**
- Classical concepts as **heuristics**, not dogmas
- Empirical testing in diverse contexts
- Openness to theoretical modification

### 6.2 Case Selection

Cases should test theoretical propositions:

| Case | Tests |
|------|-------|
| Uber (US) | Rent vs. profit; algorithmic management |
| Amazon Mechanical Turk (Global South) | Value chain; exploitation rates |
| Deliveroo (Europe) | Worker organizing; regulatory response |
| TikTok (China/ Global) | Platform imperialism; data colonialism |
| WeChat (China) | Alternative platform model; state relations |

### 6.3 Data Needs

To assess continuity/rupture:

| Data Type | Source | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Platform financials | Annual reports, SEC filings | Profit/rent analysis |
| Worker surveys | Academic, union, NGO | Exploitation rates, conditions |
| Regulatory proceedings | EU, FTC, national courts | Governance analysis |
| Comparative historical | Industrial revolution archives | Periodization comparison |

## 7. Conclusion: Theoretical Agnosticism as Method

This research project adopts **theoretical agnosticism** as a methodological principle:

1. **Don't decide in advance** whether digital capitalism is "new" or "same"
2. **Use classical concepts** as heuristics to investigate
3. **Follow the evidence** — modify theory where necessary
4. **Maintain reflexivity** — document theoretical choices and alternatives

**Quote (Weber on value-freedom):**
> "An empirical science cannot tell anyone what he should do — but rather what he can do — and under certain circumstances — what he wishes to do."

This chapter provides the theoretical toolkit. The empirical chapters that follow will test, modify, and extend these concepts through investigation of digital capitalism in practice.
