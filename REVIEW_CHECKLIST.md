# Source Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating new sources, score on these 4 dimensions (1-5 stars):

## 1. Epistemic Contribution

Does the work generate genuinely new concepts, or merely apply existing frameworks?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ★★★★★ | Paradigm-shifting concepts; reframes entire debates |
| ★★★★☆ | Significant conceptual innovation; new categories |
| ★★★☆☆ | Solid application/extension of existing theory |
| ★★☆☆☆ | Repackaging known ideas; derivative |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | No conceptual contribution; purely descriptive |

**Questions to ask:**
- Does this introduce new concepts that others now use?
- Does it reframe an existing debate productively?
- Is it merely applying Marx/Foucault/Deleuze to a new domain?

## 2. Empirical Density

Quality and depth of case studies, data, ethnography.

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ★★★★★ | Extensive fieldwork; rich data; multiple cases; rigorous |
| ★★★★☆ | Solid empirical grounding; good case studies |
| ★★★☆☆ | Some evidence; illustrative examples |
| ★★☆☆☆ | Thin empirical basis; anecdotes |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | Pure theory; no empirical component |

**Questions to ask:**
- Is the empirical work original or secondary?
- How many cases/geographies covered?
- Is the methodology transparent and rigorous?

## 3. Political Utility

Clarity for contemporary movements; strategic insight.

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ★★★★★ | Direct strategic guidance; used by movements |
| ★★★★☆ | Clear political implications; actionable analysis |
| ★★★☆☆ | Political relevance but not directly actionable |
| ★★☆☆☆ | Politically neutral or vague |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | Anti-political; obscures power relations |

**Questions to ask:**
- Does this help us understand where to intervene?
- Is it used by activists or organizers?
- Does it clarify or obscure power relations?

## 4. Synthetic Potential

Contribution to the "ideal average" analysis we're building.

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ★★★★★ | Essential building block; structural to our synthesis |
| ★★★★☆ | Strong contribution to specific dimensions |
| ★★★☆☆ | Useful but supplementary |
| ★★☆☆☆ | Tangential to our project |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | Irrelevant or contradictory to our framework |

**Questions to ask:**
- Can this be integrated into a systematic analysis?
- Does it fill a gap in our current framework?
- Would Marx have engaged with this seriously?

## Reading Priority Matrix

Use these criteria to determine reading order:

**Read First (All 4s and 5s)**
- Essential theoretical foundations
- Empirically rich core cases

**Read Second (Mixed scores, high in some)**
- Important for specific dimensions
- Contrasting perspectives

**Skim/Reference (Low epistemic or synthetic)**
- Purely empirical with no theory
- Popular books with thin analysis

**Skip (Low across board)**
- Derivative work
- Disciplinary tangents

*Use these criteria consistently when adding new sources to the literature overview.*
