Overview
The Seed2.0 series model has been officially released, offering three general-purpose agent models of varying sizes—Pro, Lite, and Mini.
The general-purpose models in this series deliver a comprehensive upgrade in multimodal understanding, with strengthened LLM and Agent capabilities that enable steady progression in real-world long-horizon tasks.
Seed2.0 further expands its capability frontier from competition-level reasoning to research-grade tasks, achieving first-tier industry performance in evaluations on high economic-value and high scientific-value workloads.
Seed2.0 Pro
Focuses on long-chain reasoning and robustness in complex workflows. Optimized for complex scenarios in real-world tasks.
Seed2.0 Lite
Balances output quality and response speed.
Ideal as a general-purpose, production-grade model.
Seed2.0 Mini
Optimized for inference throughput and deployment density. Designed for high concurrency and batch generation scenarios.
Model Performance
Seed2.0 delivers significant enhancements in visual reasoning and perception, and achieves SOTA performance on benchmarks, such as MathVision. 
For dynamic scenarios, Seed2.0 strengthens its understanding of temporal sequences and motion perception, achieving a leading position in key benchmarks such as MotionBench.
Seed2.0 further enhances its instruction-following capabilities and achieves top-tier industry performance when evaluated on complex Agent capabilities.
Multimodal Visual Understanding and Interactive Applications
Seed2.0 can process complex visual inputs and enable real-time interaction and app generation. Whether extracting structured information from images or generating interactive content via visual inputs, Seed2.0 handles tasks fast and reliably.
