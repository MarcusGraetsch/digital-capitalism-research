# Methodology and Research Ethics Statement

**Project:** Digitalpolitik und moderner Kapitalismus  
**Principle Investigator:** Marcus  
**Research Assistant:** Rook  
**Date Established:** 2026-02-01  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS

### 1.1 The Problem of Nachvollziehbarkeit in Digital Research

Max Weber argued that social science must be *nachvollziehbar* — traceable, accountable, subject to critical examination. In the digital age, this faces new challenges:

- **LLM outputs** appear authoritative but may contain hallucinations
- **Digital sources** can disappear or change without notice
- **Algorithmic curation** shapes what sources are visible
- **Speed of research** may compromise reflection depth

This project commits to maintaining Nachvollziehbarkeit through systematic documentation.

### 1.2 Research as Construction (Konstruktionscharakter der Forschung)

Following Weber's concept of *Idealtypen* (ideal types), this research acknowledges:

- "Digital capitalism" is a heuristic construct, not a natural kind
- Theoretical frameworks organize empirical material but are themselves provisional
- Research questions shape findings; transparency about this circularity is essential

## 2. METHODOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES

### 2.1 Source Criticism (Quellenkritik)

**19th-century standard applied to 21st-century research:**

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Verification** | All sources checked for existence (web_search, web_fetch, library catalogs) |
| **Provenance** | Bibliographic details complete (author, year, publisher, ISBN/DOI) |
| **Context** | Sources located in intellectual traditions, not treated atomistically |
| **Corrections** | Errors acknowledged and documented (see Session 1: removal of "Shan") |

**Digital-specific adaptations:**
- URLs archived where possible
- PDFs stored locally when legally permissible
- Screenshots of dynamic content
- Date of access recorded

### 2.2 Transparency of Process (Verfahrenstransparenz)

**What is documented:**

1. **Session logs** (`research_journal/sessions/`)
   - Date, duration, participants
   - Actions undertaken
   - Decisions made with rationale
   - Problems encountered and solutions

2. **Decision logs** (`research_journal/decisions/`)
   - Major theoretical choices
   - Scope limitations
   - Methodological innovations

3. **Git version control**
   - Every change committed with descriptive messages
   - Full history recoverable
   - Branches for experimental directions

### 2.3 Reflexivity (Reflexivität)

**Researcher positionality:**
- Marcus: Principal investigator, German context
- Rook: AI assistant, trained on specific corpora with known limitations

**Acknowledged limitations:**
- Language constraints: German/English/limited other languages
- Access constraints: Open-access sources prioritized
- Temporal constraints: Research conducted 2026; sources may become outdated

## 3. ETHICAL COMMITMENTS

### 3.1 Intellectual Honesty (Wahrhaftigkeit)

- No fabricated sources
- No misrepresented findings
- Clear distinction between:
  - Established facts
  - Working hypotheses
  - Speculative extensions

### 3.2 Non-Extractive Research

**Engaging Global South scholarship:**
- Cite authors, not just "regions"
- Avoid tokenism (representation without engagement)
- Prioritize access to sources from underrepresented contexts

**When citing non-Western scholars:**
- Full bibliographic information
- Contextualize their intellectual traditions
- Avoid "discovery" framing

### 3.3 Accountability

**To future readers:**
- This journal enables verification of claims
- Methodological choices explained, not assumed
- Limitations acknowledged

**To research subjects:**
- Platform workers, if interviewed: informed consent, anonymization
- Living scholars cited: accurate representation

## 4. LITERATURE MANAGEMENT

### 4.1 Acquisition Standards

**Priority order:**
1. Open-access scholarly sources (DOAJ, Sci-Hub alternatives, institutional repositories)
2. Library access (university subscriptions)
3. Purchase (for essential works not otherwise available)
4. Interlibrary loan

**Prohibited:**
- Purchasing from predatory publishers
- Citing sources not personally reviewed

### 4.2 Note-Taking Protocol

**Template:** See `notes/templates/reading_note.md`

**Required elements:**
- Full citation
- 4-criteria evaluation (Epistemic, Empirical, Political, Synthetic)
- Core argument (author's words where possible)
- Critical assessment (our evaluation)
- Relation to project

**Prohibited:**
- Copy-paste without quotation marks
- Paraphrase without citation
- AI summary without verification

### 4.3 Synthesis Standards

**When combining sources:**
- Clear attribution of ideas to original authors
- Explicit marking of our interpretive additions
- Distinguish:
  - "Fuchs argues..." (author's position)
  - "We interpret Fuchs as..." (our reading)
  - "Building on Fuchs..." (our extension)

## 5. COLLABORATION PROTOCOL

### 5.1 Human-AI Collaboration

**Rook's role:**
- Literature organization
- Source verification
- Draft writing (clearly marked)
- Technical infrastructure

**Marcus's role:**
- Research direction
- Theoretical judgments
- Final decisions on scope and argument
- Ethical oversight

**Transparency about AI assistance:**
- This document acknowledges AI involvement
- Drafts generated by AI marked as such
- Final responsibility remains with human researcher

### 5.2 Documentation of Collaboration

**Recorded in:**
- Session logs (who did what)
- Git commits (attribution where relevant)
- This methodology statement

## 6. REVISION HISTORY

| Version | Date | Changes | Approved by |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| 1.0 | 2026-02-01 | Initial methodology statement | Marcus |

*This methodology statement follows the German Wissenschaftstradition (science tradition) emphasizing systematicity, transparency, and accountability. It applies Weberian sociology of knowledge to contemporary digital research practices.*
