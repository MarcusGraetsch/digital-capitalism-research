# Project Evolution Log

*Documenting major shifts in research direction, scope, and methodology*

## Entry 1: Project Inception (2026-02-01)

### Trigger
Marcus initiated research on digital capitalism with a prompt response from another LLM containing ~120 sources.

### Critical Assessment of Starting Point
**Initial LLM output strengths:**
- Systematic categorization
- Mix of theoretical and empirical sources
- Recognition of key debates (rent vs. profit, value theory)

**Initial LLM output weaknesses:**
- Anglo-centric bias
- Likely hallucinations ("Shan - Digital China 2025" non-existent)
- No evaluation criteria
- Missing major theorists (Wark, Hui)
- No German scholarship

### Project Response
Rather than accepting LLM output as authoritative, project adopted critical stance:
- Verification of all sources
- Expansion of geographic scope
- Addition of evaluation framework
- Explicit methodology documentation

### Significance
Established epistemological principle: **LLM outputs are starting points, not conclusions.**
