# Research Journal: Session 1 (Continued) — Methodology Refinement

**Date:** 2026-02-01 (continuation)  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes (19:14 – 19:52 CET)  
**Participants:** Marcus (PI), Rook (AI Assistant)  
**Session Type:** Methodological reflection and clarification

---

## 1. TRIGGER

Marcus requested clarification of:
1. What "PI" (Principal Investigator) means
2. The nature of the Marcus-Rook research relationship
3. How old Wissenschaftstradition combines with new digital practice

---

## 2. ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN

### 2.1 Document Created
- **human_ai_collaboration.md** (8,306 bytes)
  - Detailed analysis of PI-AI relationship
  - Epistemological status: "Collaborative agency with asymmetric accountability"
  - Practical implications for both parties
  - Meta-connection: Studying digital labor while practicing AI-assisted research
  - Toward a new methodology for transparent human-AI collaboration

### 2.2 Documents Updated
- **ethics_and_methodology.md** → v1.1
  - Clarified PI abbreviation
  - Added reference to human_ai_collaboration.md
  - Expanded collaboration protocol section

### 2.3 Key Distinctions Established

| Aspect | Traditional Research | Our Human-AI Collaboration |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Labor | Human only | Symmetric (both contribute) |
| Accountability | Researcher | Asymmetric (PI only) |
| Decision authority | Researcher | PI has veto, AI suggests |
| Responsibility | Clear | Complex → documented transparently |

## 3. DECISIONS MADE

### 3.1 Methodological Innovation
The project will document its **own method** as a contribution:
- Not just studying digital capitalism
- Also developing standards for ethical human-AI research
- Old-school Nachvollziehbarkeit + new digital practice = new Wissenschaftstradition

### 3.2 Role Clarity
- **Marcus (PI):** Direction, judgment, verification, accountability
- **Rook (AI):** Execution, suggestion, transparency about limitations
- **Verification standard:** "Don't trust, verify" — PI checks AI outputs

---

## 4. KEY INSIGHT

The "Shan" incident (Session 1, Part 1) exemplifies the method:
- AI included unverified source
- PI requested verification
- AI could not confirm
- PI directed removal
- Process documented

**This IS the methodology:** AI-assisted research with PI oversight and full transparency.

---

## 5. NEXT SESSION

Marcus indicated readiness to begin **Session 2** — new topic/method to be determined.

---

*Session closed with mutual acknowledgment (👍) of PI-AI relationship clarity.*

**Git commits this session:**
- `587e1a1` — Clarify PI-AI research relationship and methodology
