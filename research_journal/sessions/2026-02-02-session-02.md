## Activities

### 1. Varoufakis Interview Analysis

**Input:** Marcus shared Berliner Zeitung interview with Yanis Varoufakis on techno-feudalism, China, and the Genius Act.

**Tasks completed:**
- [x] Fetched and analyzed interview text
- [x] Extracted key quotes (German original)
- [x] Created structured reading note: `notes/readings/varoufakis_interview_2026.md`
- [x] Added BibTeX entries to `literature/varoufakis.bib`
- [x] Updated literature overview with techno-feudalism section

**Key integration points identified:**
- "Cloud capital" concept bridges platform micro-logic to geopolitical macro-dynamics
- "Genius Act" analysis connects to monetary privatization theme
- Europe's "cloud capital deficit" explains regulatory weakness
- 40% rent extraction claim needs verification

**Critical gaps noted:**
- Weak on worker agency within fiefdoms
- Overstates rupture with capitalism (Durand critique relevant)
- Ignores European regulatory capacity (GDPR, DSA, DMA)

## Decisions Made

1. **Adopt Varoufakis framework** for Chapter on Platform Economics, but with Durand critique as counterpoint
2. **Add monetary privatization subsection** to Global Governance chapter (Genius Act analysis)
3. **Flag for verification:** 40% platform fee claim; find empirical sources
